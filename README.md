# Mediversal

Please note that my website has not been deployed to the web yet due to data-file upload issues. This guide is simply for future users NOT judges, as if the website is already live. 

You will not be able to download the project locally as it requires API keys that cost money. Please simply watch the demo to understand how my project works.
